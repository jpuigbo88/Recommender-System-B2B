# Recommender-System-B2B

In this code we build a recommender system for a B2B company supplying office products through distributors which has lots of SKUs grouped into families. For this reason, the recommended items will be families. The goal of the system is to entice the customers to click and perhaps buy products of families which they do not presently buy on the online system.
